# Data preparation

* Using `plink` find a way to:
 [] Remove SNPs where the minor allele appears in less than 5% of individuals.
 [] Remove SNPs that are missing in more than 1% of individuals.
 [] Remove individuals that are missing in more than 0.1% of SNPs.

* Bonus:
 [] Find how many SNPs are being filtered out during each step.
