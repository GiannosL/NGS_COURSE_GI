# Data preparation

* Using `plink` find a way to:
    * Remove SNPs where the minor allele appears in less than 5% of individuals.
    * Remove SNPs that are missing in more than 1% of individuals.
    * Remove individuals that are missing in more than 0.1% of SNPs.

* Bonus:
    * Find how many SNPs are being filtered out during each step.
