# Imputation of genotypes

* Prepare for imputation:
    * In your home directory create a folder called `imputation/`
    * Copy the `impute5` tool to your home directory and set an `alias` for it.
    * Copy the imputation input files.
    * Check the number of SNPs we have pre-imputation.

* Perform imputation:
    * Look in the **impute5-manual**
    * Write the appropriate command and perform the imputation.

* Post-imputation checks:
    * Check how many SNPs are in the output files.
